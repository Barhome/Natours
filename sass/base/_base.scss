// Media Query NOTES:

// beginners uses a separate file for media queries where one media query for one breakpoint contains all the selectors that we want to change their declarations and that will produce one huge media query for each breakpoint.

// the better way is to add media query in each selector

// the best way is to write a mixin to easily change the breakpoints if needed instead of going through all the media queries defined in many selectors to change the breakpoint.
